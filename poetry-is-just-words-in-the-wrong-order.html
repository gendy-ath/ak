Through a specially designed code, a computer chooses randomly phrases from a predetermined Twitter hashtag and a database of verses which are selected by the artists.

When the project is presented live, the artists build and improvise on the poem that is created by the computer. For their performance, they use some of the phrases/ verses, disregard others and add some of their own. At the same time, they integrate in their performance the sounds that are created. As the phrases/ verses are chosen randomly and real-time from Twitter and the database of verses, the outcome varies each time the project is presented. During their performance, the artists interact with, develop and rede ne the word and sound structures that are created by the computer. They urge the audience to make meaning from fragmentation,dislocation and randomness as broken and seemingly unrelated slices of discourse.">
